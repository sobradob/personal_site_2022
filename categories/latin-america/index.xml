In practice, this usually means creating accomodation listings on sites like Airbnb, messaging the guests and making sure the money gets to the hosts. About six months into doing this, I discovered a tool called &lt;a href="https://www.guesty.com/">Guesty&lt;/a> which made things considerably easier (more on this in a bit).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In September due to Hurricane Irma came. Most guests cancelled their reservations. This in itself, put many of the people we work with in a financially difficult position. Fortunately the hurricane did not hit Havana directly, although there was some flooding. Most of our clients were unaffected. Except for the Baylac family.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Costa Rican Saints</title><link>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2017/08/18/costa-rican-saints/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Aug 2017 22:22:16 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2017/08/18/costa-rican-saints/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the first things a traveller notices when going to Costa Rica is that almost every town or city is named after a Saint. Growing up in Costa Rica, I just assumed this was something true of all Latin American countries, a legacy of Spanish colonial times. California has San Jose, San Fransisco, etc. I thought it was like that from California to Argentina.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After some travelling in Latin America I realised this was simply not true. Cuba is exceptionally adept at original names (e.g. Guantanamo). Even neighbouring Nicaragua seemed to have more varied names. It turns out Costa Ricans are particularly unoriginal with names, after all approximately 10% of the population&amp;rsquo;s last name is &lt;a href="http://forebears.io/costa-rica#surnames">Rodriguez, Vargas, Jimenez, Mora or Rojas&lt;/a>. Similarly, 16% of all locations were named after a saint.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Alphabetically inspired anecdotes from Cuba: 58 years after 1958</title><link>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2016/06/12/alphabetically-inspired-anecdotes-from-cuba-58-years-after-1958/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jun 2016 11:32:32 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2016/06/12/alphabetically-inspired-anecdotes-from-cuba-58-years-after-1958/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="aviacion-de-cubana">Aviacion de Cubana&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There was no toilet paper on the Russian-made Antonov 158 plane which took me and 15 other passengers to Havana. The Cuban state airline, Cubana de Aviacion, clearly does not need have to meet profitability targets. Even the dry sandwich they served tasted of an iron curtain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not unlike the other living political museum of China, immigration and customs is relatively straightforward. If you had to guess the political system of a country based on the border control procedures youâ€™d probably guess the United States is authoritarian.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
