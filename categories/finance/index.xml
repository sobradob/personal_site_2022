Until the early 20th century, highly respected doctors would routinely engage in bloodletting to cure ailments ranging from acne to tuberculosis. While we have left bloodletting behind, we are still engaging in putatively helpful, but veritably destructive practices.
Modern know-your-customer/anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) regulations are equivalent to financial bloodletting today: They do little good and may cause a lot of harm. Yet whether we like it or not, the KYC/AML nightmare is coming to crypto.</description></item><item><title>GameFi’s Promise and Reality Are Still Worlds Apart</title><link>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2022/03/08/gamefis-promise-and-reality-are-still-worlds-apart/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2022 13:11:22 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2022/03/08/gamefis-promise-and-reality-are-still-worlds-apart/</guid><description>Originally published in CoinDesk
Among crypto&amp;rsquo;s hottest trends is GameFi, which brings Web 3&amp;rsquo;s advantages to gaming. Web 3&amp;rsquo;s meaning varies by individual but reflects rising demand among people who are spending more time and money in meta worlds to own their virtual assets, free from the interference of platform developers.
But are strong in-game property rights compatible with fun, escapist experiences that users are seeking?
Skeptics are not convinced. They say that GameFi games are not fun but rather merely repackaged versions of the worst elements of decentralized finance (DeFi).</description></item><item><title>Are Crypto Investors Savvy or Suckers?

Are crypto investors financially savvy investors who are capable of understanding the nuances of blockchain, Web 3 and decentralized finance? Or are they mostly vulnerable, uneducated speculators who are being taken advantage of?

While the agencies have issued a few helpful guidelines, their differing opinions underscore a fundamental inability to provide more sweeping and effective oversight that would protect consumers and ensure the industry&amp;rsquo;s development.</description></item><item><title>The Quest for Perp AMMs</title><link>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2021/10/04/the-quest-for-perp-amms/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 13:11:22 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2021/10/04/the-quest-for-perp-amms/</guid><description>Originally published in Deribit Insights.

What are perpetual futures? Perpetual swaps (also known as perpetual futures or perps) are the most widely used derivative product in crypto. Perps are futures contracts with no expiration or settlement. Instead of expiring on a given day, a funding rate mechanism is used to tie the price to an index of the price of the underlying asset. The funding rate mechanism is simple, several times a day participants must pay each other based on the imbalance between mark price and index price:</description></item></channel></rss>
