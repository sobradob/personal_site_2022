Growing up in Costa Rica, I just assumed this was something true of all Latin American countries, a legacy of Spanish colonial times. California has San Jose, San Fransisco, etc. I thought it was like that from California to Argentina.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After some travelling in Latin America I realised this was simply not true. Cuba is exceptionally adept at original names (e.g. Guantanamo). Even neighbouring Nicaragua seemed to have more varied names. It turns out Costa Ricans are particularly unoriginal with names, after all approximately 10% of the population&amp;rsquo;s last name is &lt;a href="http://forebears.io/costa-rica#surnames">Rodriguez, Vargas, Jimenez, Mora or Rojas&lt;/a>. Similarly, 16% of all locations were named after a saint.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
