&lt;p>The number of such articles peaked dramatically in 2017 with 124 publications, coinciding with Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s first major price surge. Since then, obituaries have steadily declined, reaching just 2 articles in 2024 despite Bitcoin crossing $100,000.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This reduction in negative predictions, from the 2017 peak to present day, suggests a notable shift in how the cryptocurrency is perceived by commentators and institutions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Crypto Should Disrupt Current Anti-Money Laundering Practices, Not Adopt Them</title><link>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2022/03/31/crypto-should-disrupt-current-anti-money-laundering-practices-not-adopt-them/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Mar 2022 13:11:22 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2022/03/31/crypto-should-disrupt-current-anti-money-laundering-practices-not-adopt-them/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Originally published in &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/03/31/crypto-should-disrupt-current-anti-money-laundering-practices-not-adopt-them/">CoinDesk&lt;/a>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Until the early 20th century, highly respected doctors would routinely engage in bloodletting to cure ailments ranging from acne to tuberculosis. While we have left bloodletting behind, we are still engaging in putatively helpful, but veritably destructive practices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Modern know-your-customer/anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) regulations are equivalent to financial bloodletting today: They do little good and may cause a lot of harm. Yet whether we like it or not, the KYC/AML nightmare is coming to crypto.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>GameFi’s Promise and Reality Are Still Worlds Apart</title><link>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2022/03/08/gamefis-promise-and-reality-are-still-worlds-apart/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2022 13:11:22 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2022/03/08/gamefis-promise-and-reality-are-still-worlds-apart/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Originally published in &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/03/08/gamefis-promise-and-reality-are-still-worlds-apart/">CoinDesk&lt;/a>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Among crypto&amp;rsquo;s hottest trends is GameFi, which brings Web 3&amp;rsquo;s advantages to gaming. Web 3&amp;rsquo;s meaning &lt;a href="https://cobie.substack.com/p/wtf-is-web3">varies&lt;/a> by individual but reflects rising demand among people who are spending more time and money in meta worlds to own their virtual assets, free from the interference of platform developers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But are strong in-game property rights compatible with fun, escapist experiences that users are seeking?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Skeptics are not convinced. They say that GameFi games are not fun but rather merely repackaged versions of the worst elements of decentralized finance (&lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-defi/">DeFi&lt;/a>). Play-to-earn games, some skeptics say, suffer because they are &lt;a href="https://frankmuci.substack.com/p/are-play-to-earn-p2e-games-pyramid?r=69dfl&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=web">more or less pyramid&lt;/a> schemes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Are Crypto Investors Savvy or Suckers?

&lt;p>Are crypto investors financially savvy investors who are capable of understanding the nuances of blockchain, Web 3 and &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-defi/">decentralized finance&lt;/a>? Or are they mostly vulnerable, uneducated speculators who are being taken advantage of?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/">The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)&lt;/a>, the U.K.&amp;rsquo;s financial regulator, believes they are the latter, while the U.K.&amp;rsquo;s tax collection agency, &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs">HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs&lt;/a>, or HMRC, believes they are the former. While the agencies have issued a few helpful guidelines, their differing opinions underscore a fundamental inability to provide more sweeping and effective oversight that would protect consumers and ensure the industry&amp;rsquo;s development. Delays in finding such common ground are slowing progress on both fronts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Quest for Perp AMMs</title><link>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2021/10/04/the-quest-for-perp-amms/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 13:11:22 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2021/10/04/the-quest-for-perp-amms/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Originally published in &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/crypto-remittances-cuba/">Deribit Insights&lt;/a>.

&lt;h2 id="what-are-perpetual-futures">What are perpetual futures?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Perpetual swaps (also known as perpetual futures or perps) are the most widely used derivative product in crypto. Perps are futures contracts with no expiration or settlement. Instead of expiring on a given day, a funding rate mechanism is used to tie the price to an index of the price of the underlying asset. The funding rate mechanism is simple, several times a day participants must pay each other based on the imbalance between mark price and index price:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
