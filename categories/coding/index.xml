&lt;p>As our activities are increasingly organised online – from business through voting to leisure time – knowing how to write (or even just understand) code is an increasingly coveted skill. Its benefits range wide; if you can code you will get a better job, improve your analytical skills, make work processes easier and cheaper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These reasons led us – Dora and Boaz, authors of this article – to set up our websites as a means of learning and practising a bit of coding. We used amazing open source projects and their online tutorials as guidance, however, we have found that these tutorials are usually not written for people with no previous background in any sort of coding/hacking. Consequently, we have decided to write a tutorial in simple English in the hope that it will make it easier for you to set up your own website and really understand the logic behind each step.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
