Out of curiosity, they said: &ldquo;We must inspect and know it by touch, of which we are capable&rdquo;. So, they sought it out, and when they found it they groped about it.<br><br>The first person, whose hand landed on the crypto exchanges, said, &ldquo;This is like an online Casino!&rdquo;. For another one whose hand reached libertarian Bitcoin believers, it seemed like a religious or political Movement. As for another person, whose hand was upon citizens of authoritarian countries evading capital controls, said Bitcoin is a Product. The blind man who placed his hand upon the cryptography papers and open source repositories, said it is a Technology.</p></blockquote><p>Cryptocurrency is a controversial topic. Yet much of the debate around it is confused because, like the blind men in the parable, both advocates and critics have a myopic view of what it is.</p><p>For the purposes of this essay I&rsquo;ll lump Bitcoin, utility tokens, smart contract platforms, DeFi, cryptocurrencies, web3 and NFTs into a single bucket and call it Crypto. Not because they are the same thing. They are not. But because most casual observers lump them together anyway, and this essay is for them. This greatly annoys specialists ranging from cryptographers to Bitcoin maximalists (including myself), but I will do it anyway. From the point of view of most laypeople, they are one and the same.</p><p>The main argument of this essay is that there are four distinct elements of Crypto. There is overlap between them, but often much less than people think. The elements are:</p><ul><li>The Casino</li><li>The Product</li><li>The Movement</li><li>The Technology</li></ul><p>Crypto critics confuse them hopelessly. A Silicon Valley developer interested in Tech will get sidelined by evangelists preaching about the Movement. Financial analysts researching the Product are blinded by the flashy lights of the Casino. But Crypto advocates aren&rsquo;t much better. Members of the Movement and representatives of the Tech are to a great extent ignorant about the actual users of the Product.</p><p>My favourite example of this is in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkjEcSmZKfc">the intro of this talk</a> (which largely inspired this essay). The talk was given at a Bitcoin conference. The CEO of Bitrefill, a company that processes 185k transactions a month from people who wish to spend their cryptocurrencies on real world items, asked the members of the audience what the most commonly used user wallets were.</p><p>Not a single person got the top one right.</p><p>If Bitcoin enthusiasts and industry insiders who go to Bitcoin conferences have no clue how users actually use Bitcoin to buy things, what hope do casual critics have of understanding what is really going on?</p><h2 id=the-casino>The Casino</h2><p><img src=/images/casino_ill1.png alt></p><p>The Casino is the shiniest of the bunch and the one most people are familiar with. The Casino advertises on TV, sponsors stadiums, football games and Formula 1. The Casino is huge, and almost everyone has heard of it. Casual observers often assume that that is &ldquo;all there is&rdquo; to Crypto.</p><p><strong>The Casino sells the vision of &ldquo;get rich quick&rdquo;.</strong> It makes money on speculators buying and selling a myriad of digital tokens to each other. Its biggest players are the exchanges: Binance, Coinbase, Crypto.com, KuCoin, OpenSea and the like. They are supported by a wide range of entertainers, influencers and snake oil salesmen.</p><p>Crypto markets are an enticing product for speculators, often more so than regular financial markets, online casinos or sports gambling.  Unlike the financial markets, crypto markets are open 24-7, meaning that wannabe traders, speculators and punters can conveniently trade on weekends or after working hours. In this respect, they compete with online casinos. But unlike online casinos, they are accessible to anyone in the world.</p><p>Whereas casinos often choose to limit their market exposure due to regulatory or technical constraints (your local online casino may not be capable of verifying proof of funds documents in Vietnamese or wiring winnings to a Nigerian bank account), crypto exchanges have had no such issues. For Binance, which started as a crypto only exchange, the payments problem was solved through crypto. And Binance and other exchanges have historically been very lax in letting people trade on their platform with little to no identity verification. This is now coming back to haunt them, as policy makers are imposing increasingly onerous regulation. But since the rise of decentralised exchanges in 2020, speculation is now permissionless and does not depend on a trusted third party like Binance.</p><p>And unlike casinos, the house does not always win! Sure the house takes its cut for the trades and will sometimes cheat you, but it&rsquo;s more like a game of poker than a roulette table. There are a myriad of ways to become a successful crypto speculator, in the same way there are infinite ways to run a successful hedge fund. You can focus on market making and arbitrage, or perhaps stalk successful addresses on the blockchain to copy trade them, or aggregate transaction data to find patterns, or try to anticipate the latest crypto narrative (AI on the blockchain?)&mldr; The possibilities are endless. For a while, a persistently profitable strategy was to set Elon Musk on notifications on Twitter and long Dogecoin every time he tweeted a dog meme. The rules are fluid, change over time and have brought enormous riches to those who manage to play well.</p><p><strong>The Crypto Casino is successful because it is open 24/7 to everyone and combines the most addictive elements of choose-your-adventure massive multiplayer online role playing games with the thrilling rush of losing money.</strong></p><p>The Casino has an ambiguous relationship with the other elements. The global infrastructure it has built is useful to the Product. It uses the language of the Movement and funds the Tech in order to give itself an air of respectability. Indeed many of the older Casino owners and operators genuinely view themselves as part of the Movement. Yet often the Casino outshines the rest. As the CEO of a non-Casino crypto company told me:</p><blockquote><p>It is hard to compete with &lsquo;get rich quick&rsquo;.</p></blockquote><p>Many of the important innovations of the Tech have been co-opted by the Casino. For instance, the Movement and the Tech spent a lot of time and effort, with minimal funding from the Casino, trying to rebuild the basic fundamental blocks of the financial system in a decentralised way. The Casino then discovered that this could also be used to create a MMORPG Casino, and to this day the biggest use case of Crypto is people trying to play money games with each other.</p><p><strong>The Casino is often at odds with the Movement and has damaged its reputation.</strong> Whereas the Movement professes self-custody, the casino doesn&rsquo;t want you to cash out your chips. People who do not trade their coins make the Casino no money. It attracts the most attention, but is also the most vapid and contains the most insalubrious characters. These tend to be attracted to the quick money, and often disappear once the rapid price appreciations are over.  In the last few years, a particularly dangerous version of the casino has emerged, where reputable looking companies like Celsius or FTX offered to take custody of your funds and packaged gambles from the casino into safe looking instruments. They then blew up. This is a dangerous game that has hurt a myriad of retail investors, which can eventually lead to a widespread regulation. Politicians can afford to look away when retail investors lose all their money on CryptoDickButts or dog coins. But it&rsquo;s another when they lose all their money on something advertised as FDIC insured, like Voyager. A problem for crypto is that when aiming to regulate the Casino, incompetent politicians and regulators may hit the Movement, the Tech or the Product instead.</p><p>The better casino operators know that it is important for the customers to win every now and then. Slowly losing cash hurts less than being hit with a huge loss. It is no surprise that CZ, the CEO of Binance, was furious when multi-billion dollar project Luna collapsed over the course of a few days.</p><center><blockquote class=twitter-tweet><p lang=en dir=ltr>5. I am very disappointed with how this UST/LUNA incident was handled (or not handled) by the Terra team. We requested their team to restore the network, burn the extra minted LUNA, and recover the UST peg. So far, we have not gotten any positive response, or much response at all</p>&mdash; CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1525060775391510529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src=https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js></script></center><p>Fortunately for crypto, regulating the Casino is incredibly unpopular with the patrons. Given that it&rsquo;s built on top of technology designed to be censorship resistant, I do not see a world where the crypto Casino gets regulated to death. Certain insalubrious elements will be repressed, but politicians and regulators do not want to push the Casino further underground. Authorities like to be able to call exchange operators to ask for favours and enforcement. They will however, start insisting that they pay more taxes.</p><p><strong>The Casino is particularly hated by economists, traditional finance and tech professionals because it makes a mockery of them</strong>. It uses their language and mimics their institutions to build and promote brazenly speculative, zero-sum games. A far greater share of Wall Street and Silicon Valley is about speculative zero-sum games than the industry insiders care to admit, and the crypto Casino holds a mirror to this reality. Nevertheless, crypto Casino is likely going to continue to gain market share on legacy casinos, legacy securities exchanges and other traditional places of gambling and speculation over the next few years. The biggest threat for the Casino is that people&rsquo;s appetite for speculation abates over the next few years. But why would people stop buying dog money?</p><h2 id=the-movement>The Movement</h2><p>But, you may ask yourself, what accidents of history have led to people buying digital ledger entries representing dog money in the first place?</p><p>It starts with the 2008 Great Financial Crisis. The consequences of the crisis can still be felt today across the West. In the UK, <a href=https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/06/09/britains-productivity-problem-is-long-standing-and-getting-worse>productivity growth </a>and <a href=https://www.statista.com/statistics/323381/total-demand-for-electricity-in-the-united-kingdom-uk/>electricity consumption</a> stalled in 2008. In the US, <a href=https://econofact.org/the-mystery-of-the-declining-u-s-birth-rate>birth rates broke</a> and haven&rsquo;t recovered.</p><p>Across the political spectrum, people were outraged that bankers seemed to manage to socialise losses while keeping the gains to themselves. While Main Street was getting evicted, Wall Street was getting bonuses. Several movements sprung out, such as Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party. Most of the movements that were born out of the Great Financial Crisis have since withered away. Yet the crypto Movement that was born with Bitcoin is thriving. In fact:</p><p><strong>Crypto is the single most successful global political movement to surge in the last decade.</strong></p><p>Crypto has been a social and political Movement from day one. The first bitcoin block contains the following newspaper headline etched into it:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Chancellor on Brink of Second Bailout for Banks&rdquo;.</p></blockquote><p>This political nature of the Movement is worth belabouring, because it hopelessly confuses Financial Times readers who cannot go beyond the mental models of EBITDA and cash flows. It bewilders the Web2 types that read TechCrunch, who are used to thinking in terms of MAUs and conversion funnels. But it also confuses many Politico readers, who either superficially assume the entire Movement is just a front for the Casino or are hoodwinked by the jargon into believing it is apolitical.</p><p>Ever wonder why Crypto refuses to die despite the <a href=https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin-obituaries/>predictions of economists, tech commentators and other self-proclaimed experts</a>? Surely, if it was a pure ponzi scheme it would have fizzled out by now? If it were useless, why is there more mindshare on crypto than ever? Why is it that every time it is pronounced dead, it comes back stronger? It is because there are thousands of smart and passionate individuals across the world that selflessly dedicate themselves to the Movement.</p><p><strong>The individuals that form the core of the Movement are not in it for the money. They are philosophically, socially and politically aligned with Crypto.</strong></p><p>Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous founder of bitcoin, seems to not have cashed out a single dime. The core developers of the two largest protocols, Bitcoin and Ethereum, are notoriously underpaid compared to what they could make in the industry or even working for FAANGs. Even Vitalik Buterin, the well-known multi-millionaire founder of Ethereum, lives a famously ascetic life. Throughout the world, meet-ups, educational material and classes are organised by enthusiastic underpaid individuals like Andreas Antonopulous who have little financial interest in doing so.</p><p>Understanding Crypto as a social and political Movement is eye-opening. It can explain the tribalism of different Crypto factions, the zealousness, the evangelism, the callous indifference towards facts of many tribe members and high priests. But it can also explain the selflessness, the sense of community, the mutual support and sincere belief in the cause. If you pay attention, you will quickly notice the ubiquitous political, utopian, and pseudo-religious language of many Crypto enthusiasts.</p><p>Online arguments about Crypto make about as much sense as political or religious arguments. People&rsquo;s minds are made, and the same way that some people will vote for the same political party for their entire lives no matter what they do, some people will put 10% of their paycheck into Bitcoin every single month no matter what. This is true for both advocates and critics. Many &ldquo;refutations&rdquo; of crypto from &ldquo;technology experts&rdquo; or &ldquo;economists&rdquo; essentially boil down to &ldquo;I disagree with the political values this implies.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>But what are these political values? It is a Movement that is disillusioned with existing institutions. It believes that these institutions are inherently flawed and impossible to reform.</strong> The only alternative is to use technology and cryptography to build a better system from the ground up.</p><p>In Satoshi&rsquo;s words:</p><blockquote><p>The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that&rsquo;s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.  - <strong>Satoshi Nakamoto</strong></p></blockquote><p>The aim is to design an open and transparent world where individuals are free from the burden of government oppression. Property rights and ownership are to be determined by the mathematics backing public key cryptography, not biassed courts and corrupt politicians. It is a vision of an egalitarian, open and transparent system where all rules are enforced equally, where big banks are just as likely to get foreclosed as homeowners. A world where anyone in the world can interact economically with anyone in the world, without interference from the state and with minimal risk of confiscation.</p><p>Like all social and political movements, it is fraught with contradictions. Crypto is highly individualist, in the sense that it encourages self-reliance and independence from &ldquo;<a href=https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/>trusted third parties</a>&rdquo;. It places a strong emphasis on the rights of the individual versus the tyranny of the collective. But there is a powerful collectivist voluntarism to it too, which stems from the desire to build new and better institutions. Bitcoiners build communes around the world, such as Bitcoin Beach and Bitcoin Jungle. These can grow to have significant political influence, <a href=https://www.wired.com/story/crypto-remittances-cuba/>such as in El Salvador</a>.  Ethereans have been obsessed with Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) since day one, which are a rebranding of cooperatives for the digital age.</p><p>Another of the Movement&rsquo;s many contradictions is that utopian idealism is married to cynicism.  While a lot of the essential critical crypto infrastructure is built and maintained by selfless believers, it also assumes that &ldquo;rational&rdquo; individuals are greedy and motivated by self-interest. There is a powerful school of nihilism that believes that all human institutions and values are flawed and self-serving. In simple terms:</p><blockquote><p>Everything is a scam.</p></blockquote><p>This is professed by crypto thinkers from multiple different tribes, ranging from the <a href=https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/everyones-a-scammer/>Bitcoin Maximalist Bitstein</a> to so-called Profit Maximalist <a href="https://twitter.com/DegenSpartan/status/1555840437247946752?s=20&amp;t=vruFR2720vtzU8H0G8bXeg">Degen Spartan</a>. This cynicism often does not spare crypto itself. As some crypto proponents put it: &ldquo;Yes crypto is a scam, but everything else is a scam too, and at least crypto is OUR scam&rdquo;.</p><p><img src=/images/everything_scam.png alt></p><p>A philosophy of cynicism and disillusionment has fallen upon fertile ears in the youth. Baby boomers are a numerous generation. They are living and working for longer than any generation before. In the developed world, young people have been pushed out of the <a href="https://twitter.com/sobradob/status/1551512854112702465?s=20&amp;t=R4BJUlLUWmGjjrsfgeee0w">arts, corporate careers, politics, science by</a> this demographic trend. Young people have been priced out of the housing market and the legacy financial markets. The majority of Brits born after 1991 have lost in every single election they voted in. Young people <a href=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62525269>spend up to 30% of their gross income on rent</a>, receive increasingly less government assistance and increasingly higher taxes.</p><p>In much of the rich world, young people don&rsquo;t vote because they&rsquo;ve never seen it work, they don&rsquo;t save money because they are priced out of housing and starting a family. They don&rsquo;t even believe in taxes and wealth redistribution. The <a href=https://www.if.org.uk/research-posts/age-bias-government-spending-by-age/>benefits go to the old and rich majority of the electorate while taking from the young and poor</a>. Facing underwhelming prospects professionally and politically, too poor to raise a family and too boring to party, young people increasingly have retreated to the virtual world they feel comfortable in. This can be gaming, gambling and social media, but also Crypto.</p><p><img src=/images/generation_moonshot.png alt></p><p>This favours both the Casino and the Movement. Virtual escapism has been acknowledged<a href=https://www.binance.com/en/blog/from-cz/who-is-guangying-chen-and-is-binance-a-chinese-company-2386330931319516973> as a key factor by</a> both CZ, the owner of the largest crypto exchange, <a href="https://twitter.com/GCRClassic/status/1549738175622516736?s=20&amp;t=B_IPK10HLbBqCKeqnwRf6Q">and GCR</a>, a successful political forecaster and crypto trader.  An inability to accumulate capital makes people willing to punt with the little capital they have on dog coins. An inability to influence institutions through traditional politics gives young people an incentive to build a Movement that builds around it.</p><p><strong>Yet the virtual escapism, nihilism and cynicism do not eclipse the inherent optimism and idealism required of those who set out to change the world.</strong> Despite the cynicism, there is a strong belief that the world can be a better place, coupled with a vision of how to achieve it. No matter how vague or fraught with contradictions this vision can be, it is a vision that has persisted and grown from the fringe to the mainstream. Other than crypto conferences, where else do young people gather to imagine what a better world could look like?</p><h2 id=the-product>The Product</h2><p><img src=https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/YHgW-ZYUPf94W_ktqtRJQNwCqGmh1QIummtPq3kkJ-NSY30DjS-6BXqsamn9YwzcFi2gduOLmkdLqzoSEB248Z056FhSEu6BrNgUxb2Q3YDY9hgUbHhiEl8KpZ40_WMnul9DyR4VMdkQLSFROc15t1Q alt></p><p><em>Cuban informal cash remittance operator accepts payments in PayPay, Zelle and Bitcoin. They are unlikely to be writing about either Crypto or PayPal on Twitter.</em></p><p>Crypto as a Product refers to instances when people use crypto because it is the best way or only way to do something. Users of the Product don&rsquo;t particularly care about the ideological baggage of the Movement. What they care about is a Product that solves whatever problem they have.</p><p><strong>Crypto as a Product is understudied, misunderstood and underreported.</strong> One reason is that analyses of crypto as a Product are influenced too much either by:</p><ul><li><p>Critics who think (or want to think) the Casino (or crime) is the whole story</p></li><li><p>Casino operators seeking narratives that place them in the best possible light.</p></li><li><p>Movement evangelists who conflate how people use crypto with how it could or should be used</p></li></ul><p>Another reason why crypto as a Product is underreported is that users are incentivised to keep quiet. <strong>The main advantage of crypto as a Product is that it can be used in permissionless and censorship-resistant fashion.</strong> Hence, most of the users of the Product are using it for something that they wouldn&rsquo;t get permission for or would get censored. So while members of the Movement are incentivised to talk loudly about crypto, the exact opposite is true for actual users of the Product.</p><p><strong>Moreover, both critics and advocates keep looking for high-frequency low-volume examples of Product useage (i.e. buying coffee with bitcoin), when the reality is that it is mostly a low-frequency high-volume Product.</strong> It is underappreciated the extent to which Product use is B2B. There are a few reasons for this. First, crypto remains somewhat cumbersome to use, so some degree of specialised knowledge is needed. Second, the added complexity and volatility makes crypto mostly useful for larger transactions, which are more frequently made by businesses than individuals. In other words, crypto adoption in Nigeria is not so much people using Bitcoin to buy a latte, but rather local companies sending coins over to Alibaba vendors in China to import goods. Often the end consumer does not realise crypto rails were used to deliver the product or service they bought. The Nigerian importer that evaded bureaucrats & capital controls does not have an incentive to publicise the use of crypto, nor does the Chinese merchant that may or may not be paying taxes. Importantly, neither of them makes rushes to tell journalists that they used crypto. And why would they? They don&rsquo;t make a big deal of using Gmail or Microsoft Excel either.</p><p><strong>The users of the Product are isolated from the other elements</strong>. They are much smaller than the Casino and far less loud than the Movement. They are generally people who are disenfranchised from the global financial system, such as <a href=https://decrypt.co/50491/cuba-bitcoin-adoption/>Cubans</a>. Even within rich countries, the Federal Reserve found that Americans making under $25000 a year were <a href=https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2022-report-economic-well-being-us-households-202305.pdf>twice more likely to use Crypto</a> for transactional purposes than the higher income groups. Around 6% of Black Americans have used Crypto for transactional purposes compared to 1% of White Americans.</p><p><strong>Users of the Product do not often attend crypto conferences, the same way that you would not attend a Fintech conference if you are a Wise.com or Stripe user</strong>. Anecdotally, I know of a Cuban freelancer who has been paid in (and mostly held) Bitcoin for over three years. The first Bitcoin conference in Cuba happened a few blocks away from her house last year. She had zero interest in attending. Crypto conferences are where members of the Movement and the Tech gather, with the Casino often footing the bill.</p><p>Many crypto companies are torn between serving the users of the Product and satisfying the evangelists of the Movement. Users of the Product value convenience and ease of use. The Movement favours decentralisation, self-custody and censorship-resistance. Many of the recent controversies on Twitter (such seemingly technical debates around replace-by-fee settings in Bitcoin Core, optimistic rollup sequencer decentralisation,  the Ledger&rsquo;s private key recovery process and the Wasabi Wallet coin control or lack of thereof ) are essentially about technical compromises between the principles of the Movement and the convenience demanded by users.</p><p><strong>This is yet another paradox of crypto: while the Movement professes self-custody and rejects trusted third parties, an embarrassing amount of users store their assets with unreliable exchanges and custodians (think FTX)</strong>. The most popular, user friendly tools often make the greatest (sometimes fatal) compromises.</p><p>Despite these drawbacks, I know crypto has found a product-market fit, because it was an <a href=https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2021/06/04/on-the-brink-on-bitcoin-adoption-trends-in-cuba/>essential part of my online tourism business</a>.  Crypto has found product-market fit in:</p><ul><li><p>Global capital raising</p></li><li><p>Certain niches of e-commerce payments (particularly where there is high chargeback risk)</p></li><li><p>Cross-border transfers (particularly in grey or black jurisdictions)</p></li><li><p>Savings accounts (in places with little access to high quality fiat currencies)</p></li></ul><p>If you are a crypto sceptic, particularly one from a wealthy nation with a stable currency, you may be wondering just how many Nigerian businesses there are that use crypto to buy things from Alibaba merchants or to hide their money from corrupt third world governments. Is this not just a crypto bro fantasy?</p><p>Not according to the IMF. Earlier this year the IMF put out a <a href=https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2023/02/23/pr2351-imf-executive-board-discusses-elements-of-effective-policies-for-crypto-assets>paper</a> on crypto, saying that:</p><blockquote><p>&mldr; while the supposed potential benefits from crypto assets have yet to materialize, significant risks have emerged. These include macroeconomic risks, which encompass risks to the effectiveness of monetary policy, capital flow volatility, and fiscal risks.</p></blockquote><p>These aren&rsquo;t just empty words on an academic paper that happens to have been published by the IMF. The IMF bail-out of Argentina came with provisions that forced the government to adopt a strong <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/argentina-imf-bailout-deal-includes-190748787.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEkRLHin-krMHEws66-rLGmlkfdmwf7m1dZk6CREmyEYSXj2z5gw59KhhwE6KVYtSDx6Eva-9krURRgtSWZXllEJGzvGpWdD37u6aeXG55xY7FhZRiOhvk91BXKzQEMxgnPEJCXzFBqgw1XV3H51QVSGg3Hadl9mEz9Sc3lI1WlJ">anti-crypto stance</a>.  When the IMF says that crypto poses &ldquo;risks to the effectiveness of monetary policy&rdquo;, what they mean is that they make things like the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corralito>corralito</a> harder to implement. According to Wikipedia, the &ldquo;corralito&rdquo; was:</p><blockquote><p>the informal name for the economic measures taken in Argentina at the end of 2001 by Minister of Economy Domingo Cavallo in order to stop a bank run which implicated a limit of cash withdrawals of 250 ARS per week (at that time 1 USD = 1 ARS)[&mldr;] US denominated debt and deposits were forcibly exchanged for argentine pesos at 1.4 pesos per dollar for deposits and 1.0 for debt. [&mldr;] After the forced exchange, people no longer had any dollars on the system and those who had savings in US dollars lost 65% of their deposited value.</p></blockquote><p>In other words, Argentine depositors had their US dollar denominated deposits redenominated to be worth 65% less. The government at the time reasoned that this drastic measure was essential to stop capital flight from the country and prevent a complete meltdown of the Argentine banking system.</p><p>Whether or not this is true, the crypto-enabled vision of an egalitarian world where property rights are determined by cryptography is at odds with the ability of governments and central banks to enact this sort of policy. The IMF is taking this challenge seriously. As are the Argentines, who recently elected a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_Milei>strong bitcoin advocate</a> in their primary presidential elections.</p><h2 id=the-tech>The Tech</h2><p>Originally Cypherpunks knew how to write both code and essays. Satoshi himself wrote both the whitepaper and the original Bitcoin implementation. As the Movement grew, there was an increasing specialisation of labour. Those who can write and speak became evangelists for the Movement. Those that can code built the Tech.</p><p>This essay will not dwell too long on the specifics of technological achievements. It is beyond the scope of this essay to judge the contributions of crypto to cryptography or computer science. I am not the right person to comment on <a href=https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/550>Robust Asychronous Schnorr Threshold Signatures</a> or <a href=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-26954-8_23>scalable zero-knowledge without trusted setups</a>. Instead, let&rsquo;s discuss the motivations of the developers and academics building and researching the space.</p><p>There are hundreds (if not thousands) developers building crypto applications. While the field has professionalised over the last few years, many of them are volunteer open source contributors. The egalitarian, collaborative open source ethos is pervasive. I know it might be hard for cynics and critics to believe this, given the flashy lights of the Casino, but the most influential crypto developers are working on the problem either for ideological reasons, or because they find the work an interesting technical challenge. Often both!</p><p><strong>Why is Crypto intellectually stimulating for technologists? In addition to the aforementioned ideological reasons, partly because it is the only way for hobbyists to build financial applications.</strong> Most financial applications are either closed off from the general public or highly regulated, meaning that hobbyists have little room to tinker or engage in permissionless innovation. And there is nothing that innovators love more than to tinker. Another reason why crypto captures mindshare amongst researchers and builders is that it is full of difficult unsolved problems. Satoshi set out to design and build systems designed to withstand powerful, well funded adversaries. It is much more exciting than building B2B SaaS products.</p><p>As a consequence, making money and building a Product that people use is often an afterthought. This is not unique to crypto, developers in general are guilty of this. Often they have devoted hours of time to build cathedrals that will always remain empty, never to be used for their intended purpose. The Casino can be demoralising to them. Many developers have had pangs of grief watching dog coins and ape pictures capture mindshare and users while their own innovative solutions languished unused.</p><p>At least some of the work has found uses outside of crypto. Even the most ardent critics will admit that of the deluge of money that went into crypto, at least a fraction ended up funding non-cryptocurrency related academic and applied cryptography. A recent example is the <a href=https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/merge_requests/702>merging of a Proof of Work</a> solution with close ties to Monero to Tor, the most widely used privacy focused browser in the world.</p><p>Yet, there are distinct advantages to this ideology and curiosity driven development. The ability to deploy a global financial contract without having to request anyone for permission is highly appealing to many developers.  A recurring theme in Crypto is of technologies which were theoretical ideas in the latter half of the 20th century, such as <a href=http://www.hit.bme.hu/~buttyan/courses/BMEVIHIM219/2009/Chaum.BlindSigForPayment.1982.PDF>Chaumian e-cash</a> or <a href=https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/mktscore.pdf>automated market makers</a> for prediction markets have been turned into productised implementations such as <a href=https://cashu.space/>Cashu</a> or <a href=https://polymarket.com/>Polymarket</a>. Bitcoin itself was the productised amalgamation of earlier theoretical ideas. There&rsquo;s a considerable amount of work that goes into turning theory into code. Even something as simple as sending one token to another person has <a href=https://www.notonlyowner.com/learn/what-happens-when-you-send-one-dai>significant complexity</a>.</p><p><strong>The Cypherpunks dreamed of a world where people used public private key cryptography to further privacy and human rights. Today, Crypto has put private keys in the hands of millions and cryptographic key management has never been easier.</strong> It does not matter that the users of private key management solutions are trading NFTs or encrypting private messages, the technical problems that need to be solved are somewhat similar. And all this has only been possible thanks to (often underappreciated and underpaid) developers.</p><h2 id=the-end->The End ?</h2><p>What is next for crypto, Movement, Casino, Product, Tech and all?</p><p>The Movement needs to ask itself: can you find a solution to political and social problems purely through cryptography? <a href=https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/threads/1/>Even Satoshi does not seem to think so</a>.</p><p><img src=/images/political_problem_crypto.png alt></p><p><strong>Yet perhaps from Satoshi&rsquo;s perspective, crypto has already won.</strong> The populace has been granted a powerful weapon to wield against the oppressive forces of the State. Anyone in the world can send anyone in the world value over the internet. A new territory of freedom has been acquired for at least a few years and individuals have a powerful weapon at their disposal to defend themselves against overbearing states.</p><p>A powerful demonstration of how crypto has achieved that has come from the Russian political dissident <a href=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-politics-navalny-crypto-curren-idUSKBN2AB2GR>Alexey Navaly&rsquo;s chief of staff</a>:</p><p><img src=/images/navalny_crypto.png alt></p><p>Importantly, this is a political victory. <strong>Political victories are not victories in the same sense that Amazon has &ldquo;won&rdquo; ecommerce and Google has &ldquo;won&rsquo;&rsquo; online search</strong>. Just because anyone in the world &ldquo;can&rdquo; send Bitcoin to anyone across the world doesn&rsquo;t mean they do, in the same way that the legalisation of interracial or same sex marriages does not mean that everyone will be in an interracial same sex marriage. Political victories are not measured in terms of KPIs or MAUs, but in terms of acquired rights.</p><p>Both the Product and the Movement are now facing serious regulatory and political scrutiny. President Obama famously lamented that cryptography enabled everyday people to walk around with a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZfjGOj4FT0">Swiss bank account in their pocket</a>&rdquo;. Swiss banks have of course existed for centuries, but their services are for the most part discreet, limited to rich people and an unpopular target for politicians. Despite the occasional hiccup, most Swiss banks do try not to bank the most brazen Colombian, Iranian or Russian funny money. On the other hand, due to its political origins, Crypto is boisterous and permissionless, meaning that Iranian officials can brag online about using cryptocurrencies to avoid US sanctions.</p><p><strong>The Product enables everyday people to evade capital controls, state censorship and confiscation.</strong> From the Movement&rsquo;s point of view, this is a noble form of civil disobedience. In the eyes of financiers, regulators and politicians, this is flagrantly illegal behaviour. There are Big Tech analogies of course. Uber and Airbnb were blatantly illegal for a while (and still are in some jurisdictions). But the power of taxi commissions and hotel inspectors pales in comparison to that of central bankers. Bankers and regulators may be slow and clumsy, but they are not stupid. Does this mean that a regulatory showdown is inevitable?</p><p>Satoshi knew that cryptography was never supposed to provide a permanent solution to political problems. <strong>Crypto may have won the first round, but the Leviathan of the state has now been awakened, and the crackdown on crypto will begin in earnest</strong>. Perhaps the victory was only temporary, and crypto will be crushed into irrelevance by a determined state adversary. The Casino will almost certainly be reined in by the states that are able to do so. The Casino is also the most interested in reaching a deal with the politicians, as their profit margins depend on it. Another possibility is that the Movement will have to make political compromises to partially achieve some of its goals. Or perhaps the Movement can reach a resounding victory and change the world on its own terms.</p><p>I personally believe time is on crypto&rsquo;s side.  Keep in mind that two of the biggest boogeymen of the Movement, modern fiat currency and the <a href=https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2022/03/31/crypto-should-disrupt-current-anti-money-laundering-practices-not-adopt-them/>Bank Secrecy Act</a>, are both in some sense the legacy of Richard Nixon and are thus relatively recent inventions. They are by no means some state of nature, although the underlying wish of rulers to control and devalue the money of their subjects is eternal.</p><p>Millennials, many of whom are coin owners and are keen on their digital rights, will inherit the boomer&rsquo;s wealth and power in the next few decades. In the same way that the hippies and the homeowners campaign together to limit the supply of housing, the Movement and the Casino could campaign together. The idea of central banks acquiring significant Bitcoin reserves seems far fetched now, but a lot less far fetched than 5 years ago.</p><p><strong>What is clear is that Crypto no longer exists on a theoretical plane.</strong> Whereas a few years ago it was only taken seriously by nerds on online forums, the IMF is now closely paying attention. It is widely known that Venezuelan, Turkish, Nigerian, Cuban and Argentine citizens use cryptocurrencies to escape capital controls and rapidly depreciate local currencies. Iranian trade ministers are bragging on Twitter about the use of cryptocurrencies to avoid OFAC sanctions. Bitcoin has been adopted as legal tender in a UN recognised nation state. Ransomware operators demanding Bitcoin brought the Costa Rican government to its knees. US senators and presidential candidates have widely publicised pro-bitcoin views. Even OFAC sanctions have not (yet!) been able to stop the TornadoCash smart contract from operating, even if they have deterred many potential users.</p><p>Will the four categories continue to live on as they currently exist? It might not. There is no guarantee of future success. The Movement may have to compromise to achieve its political aims. The Casino could have its wings clipped by the government and the Product may have to flee further into the underground. The Tech could easily fade into irrelevance. But no matter what your views on crypto are and how you feel about the philosophical and political currents that inspired it, keep in mind the parable of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant#:~:text=The%20parable%20of%20the%20blind,the%20side%20or%20the%20tusk.">Blind Men and the Elephant</a>. There is often more to something than what meets the eye, particularly if it refuses to die. No matter what what the future holds, Crypto has been one of the most fascinating phenomena of the 21st century.</p></article><div class="-mx-2 mt-4 flex flex-col border-t px-2 pt-4 md:flex-row md:justify-between"><div></div><div class="mt-4 md:mt-0 md:text-right"><span class="text-primary-text block font-bold">Next</span>
