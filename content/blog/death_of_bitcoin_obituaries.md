The chart tracks the frequency of "Bitcoin obituaries" - articles declaring Bitcoin's demise - from 2010 to 2024.

The number of such articles peaked dramatically in 2017 with 124 publications, coinciding with Bitcoin's first major price surge. Since then, obituaries have steadily declined, reaching just 2 articles in 2024 despite Bitcoin crossing $100,000.

This reduction in negative predictions, from the 2017 peak to present day, suggests a notable shift in how the cryptocurrency is perceived by commentators and institutions.

The chart effectively captures this quantitative trend through a simple year-by-year bar graph, highlighting both the historical volatility in Bitcoin criticism and its recent marked decline.
