The Code of Hammurabi (c. 1700 B.C.E.) is one of the earliest known legal texts. It contains the first known formulation of _lex talonis_, best known for the biblical formulation of _an eye for an eye_. It is also the first known attempt of a regulator to cap lending interest rates:

> If a merchant lends grain at interest, for one gur he shall receive on hundred sila as interest (33 percent); if he lends money at interest, for one shekel of silver he shall receive one-fifth of a shekel as interest (20 percent).

Since ancient times people have wanted to borrow money. And rulers, no matter whether they are Babylonian kings or Washington bureaucrats, have felt the need to cap the interest rates at which people can borrow from each other. But this isn't a discussion on the moral question of small loans. I've written about on the topic [elsewhere](https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2023/05/12/pricing-profit-and-paternalism/). Rather, this is an attempt to establish some numbers and facts with regards to small loans. And when discussing the subject, regulation is a key part.

## What are small loans?

Small loans are short duration loans (<12 months) for relatively small amounts. These loans can be either unsecured (in the case of most credit cards or payday lenders) or secured (in the case of secured credit cards or pawnbrokers).

The actual distribution of loan duration and loan values depends on the market, the way the credit product is structured and customer type. For instance, a 2015 review of the payday loan industry in the UK the mean was about £260 (330 USD) with the median being around £200 (250 USD). The distribution of the loan values can be seen at the top of this article. The same 2015 UK review found that while some products offer loans up to a year, the overwhelming majority of them (80%) are to be repaid within 31 days. Excluding the small minority of loans of 12 months or more, the average duration was of 22 days.

## Why take out small loans?

Most small loans are taken out to cover general living expenses (such as groceries or utility bills) and are needed due to an unexpected increase in expenses or decrease in income.

Convenience.

The typical customer will take out multiple loans a year. In fact, the average customer

There is a strong seasonal component towards taking out loans at the beginning (or end) of the month. Within the week Fridays are the busiest day for originations. Generally September and December are high demand months, when the start of school and the Christmas holidays place a burden on the consumers' finances.

## Secular trends

While the existence pawnbrokers and moneylenders are a human universal, there are interesting recent secular trends worth exploring. Small loan providers were decimated in the post-war UK.

## Customer Acquisition & Marketing:

- Kmart and Groceries Close
- Zilch Pizza
- Consumer lenders in general have not managed to crack the digital marketing market.
- Aggregators
- US direct mail is still responsible for a great percentage of new credit card originations.
- Advertising is highly regulated and has been seen by regulators as a way to “throttle” the industry since the 1800s.

## Seasonality & Secular trends:

- Within month: Mondays are very strong in terms of demand for aggregators. Fridays are strongest in terms of demand.
- Strong September (start of School) and December (Christmas)
- UK pawnbrokers & moneylenders were decimated in the 1940-1950s. Why? Welfare state, NHS, etc. Conversely, UK pawnbrokers are now hitting all time highs after economic stagnation.

## Why are short term loans expensive?

- Academic discussions on short term loans often make two, highly contradictory statements. First they say that the short term loans industry offers extremelt expensive, overpriced loans. Then they mention that the Highly competitive but also expensive?
- Participants compete on accessibility and convenience, not price.
- Customers are generally not price sensitive.

## What are the main costs involved?

Operational:
- Cost of servicing

Repeat Custom Question:

- Is repeat custom necessary for the business?

## The APR conversation:

- Is APR easier to understand?

- People don’t pay in percentages, they pay in dollars or pounds.

## Business ease:

- But regfulation increases costs and reduces what you can do.
- Wonga etc.
