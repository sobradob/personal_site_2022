Last year [I wrote about](https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2023/09/17/a-quick-view-at-p2p-trading-volumes-on-bisq/) the problems peer-to-peer trading networks were facing. This quarter BISQ, a decentralised peer-to-peer network, has shattered all previous records.

This quarter was its highest dollar volume quarter, lead high BTC/XMR volume.

But fiat volumes are at all time highs too, with tremendous growth in the BRL and EUR pairs.

In terms of fiat payment methods, the rise of PIX in Brazil is worth pointing  out.
