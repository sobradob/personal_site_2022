The Code of Hammurabi (c. 1700 B.C.E.) is one of the earliest known legal texts. It contains the first known formulation of _lex talonis_, best known for the biblical formulation of _an eye for an eye_. It is also the first known attempt of a regulator to cap lending interest rates:

> If a merchant lends grain at interest, for one gur he shall receive on hundred sila as interest (33 percent); if he lends money at interest, for one shekel of silver he shall receive one-fifth of a shekel as interest (20 percent).

Since ancient times people have wanted to borrow money to buy things. And rulers, no matter whether they are Babylonian kings or Washington bureaucrats, have felt the need to cap the interest rates at which this happens. But this isn't a discussion on the moral question of small loans. I've written about on the topic elsewhere. Rather, this is an attempt to establish some numbers and facts with regards to small loans. And when discussing the subject, regulation is a key part.
