This film is shown surprisingly often in London, usually with two intermissions.
The Queen of Spades A quaint oldie film, fairly well done.
The Room Watching this was a lot of fun. Big cult following at the cinema, the audience was shouting out every line. You get spoons when stepping in as well.
Jackie Brown A Tartantino classic. Some say its his best, but apparently if you say this to Quentin&amp;rsquo;s face he&amp;rsquo;ll get angry at you.</description></item></channel></rss>
