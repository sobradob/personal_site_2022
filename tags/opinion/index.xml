It contains the first known formulation of lex talonis, the principle of exact retaliation. Today people are most familiar with its Biblical version: an eye for an eye.
The Code of Hammurabi is also the first known attempt of a regulator to cap lending interest rates:
If a merchant lends grain at interest, for one gur he shall receive one hundred sila as interest (33 percent); if he lends money at interest, for one shekel of silver he shall receive one-fifth of a shekel as interest (20 percent).</description></item><item><title>Old Age Originations</title><link>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2023/07/16/old-age-originations/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jul 2023 13:11:22 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2023/07/16/old-age-originations/</guid><description>In my previous post I discussed how credit score inflation contributed to the flurry of US mortgage originations in 2020-2021. As you can see from the chart below, the scale of the mortgage boom was truly unprecedented:

The Global Financial Crisis of 2007 is often blamed on irresponsible lending. Lenders offered large amounts of credit to &amp;ldquo;subprime&amp;rdquo; customers. Subprime being a fancy term for people with poor credit scores, who are less likely to pay the loans back.
According to Wikipedia:
The 2007–2008 financial crisis, or Global Financial Crisis (GFC), was a severe worldwide economic crisis that occurred in the early 21st century.</description></item><item><title>Pricing, Profit and Paternalism</title><link>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2023/05/12/pricing-profit-and-paternalism/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2023 13:11:22 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2023/05/12/pricing-profit-and-paternalism/</guid><description>What do you do when you discover your most profitable customers are using your product wrong?

Nation states are as powerful as ever, and social &amp;amp; technological conditions seem very different to the age of exploration in which these entities thrived. For example, in the 1700s it took orders from European rulers months to arrive in the far East.
