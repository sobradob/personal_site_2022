The word &amp;ldquo;salary&amp;rdquo; comes from the Latin word &amp;ldquo;salarium,&amp;rdquo; which originally referred to a soldier&amp;rsquo;s allowance for the purchase of salt. Salt was a valuable commodity up until modern times, often used as a preservative and for seasoning. Sometimes even as a currency in trade. The Latin word &amp;ldquo;salarium&amp;rdquo; is derived from &amp;ldquo;sal,&amp;rdquo; meaning salt. The median UK salary after tax is about £2400 a month, which buys about 2 tons of salt.</description></item><item><title>The Tulip Craze Conspiracy</title><link>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2024/03/23/the-tulip-craze-conspiracy/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Mar 2024 13:11:22 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2024/03/23/the-tulip-craze-conspiracy/</guid><description>Have you heard of the Dutch Tulip craze? If so, you&amp;rsquo;ve likely fallen victim to centuries old propaganda. The Dutch tulip bubble of the 17th century never actually happened, at least not the way it is understood in popular culture.
The popular understanding of the tulip craze goes as follows:
Between 1634 and 1637 Dutch people were engaged in a speculative fever, whereby a wide cross-section of Dutch society gambled on the price of tulips. Peasants who speculated correctly on the price of tulips ended up wealthier than lords.</description></item><item><title>Boaz's Review of Books: Violence, elaborate lies and a literary journey through China and Africa</title><link>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2016/04/18/boazs-review-of-books-violence-elaborate-lies-and-a-literary-journey-through-china-and-africa/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Apr 2016 09:48:37 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2016/04/18/boazs-review-of-books-violence-elaborate-lies-and-a-literary-journey-through-china-and-africa/</guid><description>The books I finished reading recently that I thought might be interesting to comment upon were Steven Pinker’s The better Angels of Our Nature, Mo Yan’s Big Breast’s and Wide Hips, Kapuscinski’s The Shadow of the Sun, Robert Mazur’s Infiltrator and David Maurer’s Big Con . Steven Pinker, a psychologist at Harvard, wrote a (way too long) book to argue the world is becoming less, not more violent. What about ISIS, Ukraine, gang warfare and mass shootings?</description></item><item><title>Boaz's Review of Books</title><link>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2016/02/17/boazs-review-of-books/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Feb 2016 22:22:16 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2016/02/17/boazs-review-of-books/</guid><description>A few books I recently finished reading are Ben Bernanke&amp;rsquo;s Courage to act, Dr Philip Tetlock&amp;rsquo;s Superforecasting, Peter Thiel’s Zero to One, an unofficial biography on George Soros, and collection of druggie short stories titled Acid House by Irvine Welsh. I do not expect to do justice to the arguments in the books (read a real book review if you want that), I&amp;rsquo;m just sharing the lessons I learned from them as a little exercise.</description></item><item><title>What I read in 2015</title><link>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2015/12/27/what-i-read-in-2015/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Dec 2015 22:22:16 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://boazsobrado.com/blog/2015/12/27/what-i-read-in-2015/</guid><description>I bought my Kindle slightly over a year ago, and since it has accompanied me everywhere I&amp;rsquo;ve been. It has provided me with entertainment on long journeys and education in subjects where I had none. I would like to share some of my favourite quotes. I have sorted them based on when I started reading them, with some slight editing.
