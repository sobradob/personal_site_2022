Steven Pinker, a psychologist at Harvard, wrote a &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/review/R2F21HEM6W56FI/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=0141034645&amp;amp;channel=detail-glance&amp;amp;nodeID=266239&amp;amp;store=books">(way too long)&lt;/a> book to argue the world is becoming less, not more violent. What about ISIS, Ukraine, gang warfare and mass shootings? Terrible things, but not nearly as violent as the Thirty Year War or Genghis Khan. This is based on relative homicide rates, or simply put: how many people die a violent death as a percentage of the population. You might be one of those paleo diet people who idealises the “peaceful” times of back when we were hunter-gatherers, living in the comfort of nature eating fruits off trees and fish out of the water. It turns out that was the most violent time we ever lived. In fact, even in the last 50 years there has been a substantial decrease in violence in the world. Even terrorism isn’t what it &lt;a href="http://globalriskinsights.com/2016/03/19640/">used to be&lt;/a>.
